# drkslv-nextjs
This is my attempt at creating a dynamic and "responsive" Website using React and Next.js.
It is the successor to a jQuery-HTML Website that served as the Frontend to a "Social Media Server" built with Node. 

![ProjectFavicon](https://drkslv.github.io/n/android-chrome-192x192.png)

At this Point in Time, this Site is not actually communicating with any Backend, and there is no actual content here.

I plan on changing that, but i might just not.

Features to be considered:
- (getting the Favicon to show up)
- Reimplementing Account Login/Signup/Dashboard
- Reimplementing Posting/Voting/Commenting 
- (The Chat works but depends entirely on the missing Backend + lacks Features)
- A *respectable* Landing/Home Page
- A Basic Blog System + File Upload Capabilities

Of course a critical first step is finding a place to host the Node.js Server
(+Free Mediafire to host File Uploads or smth desperate along those lines)

Another critical factor is that i hate myself and might *give up* before finishing this Project
